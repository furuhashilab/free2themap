### Main Theme Song "Free to the Map" 

Free to the Map

-

''We've been lookin' for you　　long long time

The information you have　　is gonna disappear

But It's gonna be a treasure　　if you share it with everyone

We've been makin' the Open map　　long long time

On a white and blank paper　　the map have been appeared 

take a good look at the map　　it's surely beautiful

gether everyone's power　　and let get every body dance


We've been waitin' for you　　long long time

The girl who have been in　　a closed cave(ANAGURA)

thanks to give it a name,　　so everyone can call

Let's have the festival　　cool and fun

Take my hand, take your hand,　　take everyboday's hand

No matter who you knew　　or you didn't know

gether everyone's power　　and let get every body dance

''
